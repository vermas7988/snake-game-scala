/**
 * Your task is to model a Snake game, logic wise only.
 * There's a summary of what Snake is below.
 *
 * No need for a fancy UI or threading, if you need to display something do it in Std.out!
 *
 * Steps:
 *   1) Model the board (that wraps around), the snake and food pellets.
 *   2) Place a size 2 snake in the middle of the board and a food somewhere else than the snake.
 *   3) `Display` board state in the console (ASCII "art") => snake = + / pelet = # / empty = .
 *   4) Define a method that performs a 'step' of the game
 *     - takes a possible user input as parameter
 *     - is called from outside (Launcher?) at a regular time interval
 *     - update the board's state
 *   5) Code an input sequence that eats the first food pellet.
 *   6) Randomise food pellet placement

/**
 * Summary: Snake game
 *
 * You control a Snake that moves around in a grid, the snake spans over a couple cells at the beginning.
 * You can only turn the snake left or right and it moves one cell every "game turn".
 * There is always one food pellet on the grid.
 * Goal of the game is to eat said pellets by moving the snake to its position.
 * When the snake eats a pellet it grows one cell longer.
 * If the snake collides with itself, the game is lost.
 * If the snake reaches one of the grid's borders, it wraps around (i.e. going out on the left side means you come back in on the right side).
